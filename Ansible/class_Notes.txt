	- Why we need Ansible ?
	
	- Ansible Architecture 
		- Master & Client Architecture:
		
	- Ansible Components 
		
		- Ansible Controller 
			- Install Ansible 
			- Maintain the Ansible Modules and Inventory file 
			
		- Ansible Nodes :
			- Target Machines/Clients that can be configured through Ansible Controller 
			
		Inventory file :
			- Used to define the Ansible Nodes details
			- Host Name, User Name and Credentials - SSH Keys / Password 
			
		Ansible Modules :
			- It is a script or function that gets injected into the target machine.
			- These Modules are based of Python Scripts 
			- Ansible Inject/push the modules from the Ansible Controller Machine into the Ansible Nodes, perform the desired Task, and Once the Task is over, it will delete that module from that target machine. 
			
			Ansible_Controller 						Ansible_Node1 
			
				setup_Java_BuildServer.sh		==>	Copy setup_Java_BuildServer.sh and Execute this script in Ansible Node1
					apt install git 
					apt install jdk
					apt install maven
						
						
			- Ansible Use the Push Mechanism 
			
			
		Ansible is Agentless.
			
			
		- Ansible Config File :
