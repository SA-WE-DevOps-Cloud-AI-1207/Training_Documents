	- Continuous Monitoring :
		- It is used to monitor the infra-structure and Applications based on the monitorig frequency
		- This is to ensure high-availability of the applications 
		
		- Infra-Structure Monitoring
			- Prometheus/Grafana/Dyna-trace/Nagios/Splunk
			
			- Used ot Monitor the CPU/Memory utilizations
			
		- Application Monitoring 
		
			- AppDynamics / DataDog	
			
			
			
	- Production Support / Monitoring Team 		==> 24/7 need for production
				
	
	- Infra-Struture Monitoring using Prometheus/Grafana :::::
	
		- Prometheus 	: Infra-structure Monitoring 
					
			CPU/Memory Utilization 
			
				Threshold Limit : 	75% of CPU Utilization
									75% of Memory Utilization
									85% of Resource Utilization
		
		- Grafana 		: Visualization Tool 	
							- Used to create Monitoring Dashboards
